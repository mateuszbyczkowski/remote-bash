# remote-bash
Remote bash execution using RPC.

## Introduction
This application is made for Tools of Distributed Processing (NPR) labs purpouses.

Both client and server are written in C++.

Project is generated by ```rpcgen -a -C remoteBash.x``` command.

## Concept
I am using C background function popen where I pass command from client.
The pros of this solution is the fact that popen creates process with stream that returns standard output which I can return back to client. The only downside of usage this function is impossibility to pass standard input to this execution by server. This function is not implemented in remote-bash application.

The general idea was to run client and type any string based command like in real bash. Send command (C++ string) as parameter of remote server call. Server perform command (if it's possible) and return result (as string) and execution status (as int), it command execution failed it returns status 1 and error message. Client take results and print it.

## Usage
First use ```make -f Makefile.remoteBash``` command to build project.

Next, you have to run server by ```sudo ./remoteBash_server```.

And you can call any command you want by ```sudo ./remoteBash_client localhost "cat remoteBash.x" ```.

Where first argument of execution is host and second is command which you want to remotely execute (as string).
